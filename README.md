# MilaFoods

MilaFoods is a social media app focused on restaurants in Milagres-CE and their clients.

It was developed as the final project for the Software Lab subject of the [technical IT course](https://www.instagram.com/inforanazeliaoficial/) at [EEEP Irmã Ana Zélia da Fonseca](https://eeep-irma-ana-zelia.netlify.app), Milagres-CE.

The app was developed using Kivy and KivyMD, and it uses Firebase for online data storage and SQLite3 for local data storage.

The project was discontinued after the completion of the subject.
